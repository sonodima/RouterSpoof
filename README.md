> ASH friendly script that spoofs mac addresses and changes network domain of OpenWRT based routers.<br>Setting up this script with the commands below, it will launch every time the router starts.<br><br>Note that changes to the domain name only take place after a reboot, so in each session you will see the previous domain name.

## Install

```sh
wget "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sonodima/RouterSpoof/master/router_spoof.sh" -O "/etc/init.d/router_spoof.sh"
chmod 755 "/etc/init.d/router_spoof.sh"
ln -s /etc/init.d/router_spoof.sh /etc/rc.d/S99router_spoof
```

## Setup

> Edit 'INTERFACES' to pick what you want to spoof.<br>Please note that spoofing every interface is not a good idea, and it may make your internet connection unusable.
```
vi "/etc/init.d/router_spoof.sh"
```
